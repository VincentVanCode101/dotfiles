* create a list of docker images that i want pulled as soon as i have a new machine
    * add an ansible job to pull all these images

* adjust my de-chris keyboard on linux so that:
    - alt-right + 7 is |
    - alt-right + l is @
    - alt-right + n is ~
    - alt-right + 5 is [
    - alt-right + 6 is ]
    - alt-right + 8 is {
    - alt-right + 9 is }
    - alt-right + shift + 7 is \

    all to resemble mac os keyboard
